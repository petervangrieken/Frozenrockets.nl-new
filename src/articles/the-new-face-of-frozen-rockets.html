		<h1>The new face of Frozen Rockets</h1>

		<p class="intro">
			I'm proud to finally present the new identity and website of Frozen Rockets. 
		</p>

		<p>
			A few months ago I asked my friend and awesome designer <a href="http://stephancsikos.nl">Stephan Csik&oacute;s</a> to work on a new brand identity for me. I'm very pleased with the result he came up with. Seriously, if you need a great graphic designer or art director, hire him!
		</p>

		<p>
			Based on his work, I designed this website, where I 'practice what I preach', so of course it's completely keyboard-accessible and it conforms to <i>WCAG 2.0</i> (accessibility) standards without it being 'boring'.
		</p>

		<h2>What's next?</h2>

		<p>
			I'll go into more details about some of the design choices and implementations on this site in more detail in some follow-up articles later, but if you like to look around, feel free to check out <a href="https://github.com/petervangrieken/Frozenrockets.nl-new">the source code on GitHub</a>. Also, if you run into any issues, <a href="./../contact.php">please let me know</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			The great thing about the web is that it can be changed at any time, so I deliberately left some work to be done (like adding ARIA roles), which I'll cover in upcoming articles on this site.
