		<h1>The difference between simple and easy</h1>

		<p>About 2 months ago I had the pleasure of attending the Beyond Tellerrand conference in Düsseldorf and watching many great talks by Ethan Marcotte, Erik Spiekermann, Jessica Hische and others. The one that stood out to me, was Stephen Hay’s talk titled Maintaining Simplicity.</p>

<p>One of the key principles in his work and in this talk is the <em>Zero Interface</em>, the concept where there is no interface between the user and his desire. Whenever the user thinks of something, the result is there. Think Amazon 1-Click without even clicking a button. This hypothetical (and perhaps ideal) interface can help us reduce complexity in our interfaces when we remember that “<em>anything you add to the zero interface is perhaps on step too many</em>” (from <a href="http://responsivedesignworkflow.com/">Responsive Design Workflow</a>).</p>

<p>I love this concept, because it shows how much thinking is involved in make something as simple as possible. Somehow there’s a misconception that designing a simple interface is easier and takes less work than making something complex. It is true that most complex interfaces are the result of years of work and new implementations, but the problem is not a lot of work has gone into thinking and considering each addition to the interface.</p>

<p>I’ve worked on project where millions of euro’s where spent on a single website. One of the problems in these projects is the clients expects results for the money he pays. These results often take form as extra functionality, and with that, extra complexity. </p>

<h2 id="difficult-vs-complex">Difficult vs. Complex</h2>

<p>When making the distinction between something difficult and something complicated, I like the Marathon Analogy: Running a marathon is very difficult, it takes a lot of training and you’ll  feel exhausted when you cross the finishline, but it’s not complicated; Just put one foot in front of the other for 42 kilometers.</p>

<hr>

<p>“A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.”</p>

<p>Complicated is not the same as difficult. Running a marathon is difficult, but it’s not complex: just put one foot in front of the other. For 26 miles.
